# React Burger Builder App

> From the Udemy course [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page)

The Burger Builder is a multi-page web app that lets you build a burger with your favourite ingredients, create an account to order the burger and sign in to retrieve your previous burger orders.

The app is created using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router). The app uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a database and for user authentication.
